        <p>Hello! My name is Ritchie Ryese Rojo and I am currently a junior at the High school of Fashion Industries. As of right now, I am planning to pursue a career in the tech world. Once I graduate, I want to attend a 4-year college and earn a computer science degree. During the rest of my high school life and through my college life, I wish to learn more about what I would like to do and future career paths I might like to take. I also want to improve my communication, problem solving and time management skills.</p>
